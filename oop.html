                                setter methods to access and modify the id and name variables, but provide a getter
                                method for the salary variable that returns a formatted string.

                                30. Write a Java program to create a class called Circle with a private instance
                                variable radius. Provide public getter and setter methods to access and modify the
                                radius variable. However, provide two methods called calculateArea() and
                                calculatePerimeter() that return the calculated area and perimeter based on the current
                                radius value.
